```gradle
def reposDir = new File(System.properties['user.home'], ".android/manual-offline-m2")
def repos = new ArrayList()
reposDir.eachDir {repos.add(it) }
repos.sort()

allprojects {
  buildscript {
    repositories {
      for (repo in repos) {
        maven {
          name = "injected_offline_${repo.name}"
          url = repo.toURI().toURL()
        }
      }
    }
  }
  repositories {
    for (repo in repos) {
      maven {
        name = "injected_offline_${repo.name}"
